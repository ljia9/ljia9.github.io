I used to be a college student studying math and computer science.

Starting my last semester of college, I practiced actively taking notes and writing or talking out loud about the stuff I learned.  I was quite happy with what how it turned out, so I wrote small math/cs blog detailing some notes or exercises I did.

If you are a recruiter looking to contact me, you can reach me using LinkedIn or email. Otherwise, if you are from an academics background, you might be more comfortable using [this page](/about1.html).
