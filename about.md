I am a college student studying math and computer science, specifically in developing algorithms, machine learning, and back-end development. Academic interests outside of computer science include elementary number theory and 20th century American literature. 

Starting last semester I practiced actively taking notes and writing or talking out loud about the stuff I learned (especially for my Data Structures and Algorithms class). I was quite happy with what how it turned out, so I plan on going a step further and keeping a small math/cs blog for the rest of my undergrad career. 

Hopefully they will be quick little posts that aim to explain a concept to the average reader (done in the style of Kalid's betterexplained posts), and will end up being a nice archive for the stuff I learned in my upper level undergrad classes.


If you are a technical recruiter looking to contact me, you can reach me using LinkedIn or email me at leigh.jia@emory.edu. Otherwise, if you are from an academics background, you might be more comfortable using [this page](/about1).
