I am a college student studying math and computer science, specifically in developing algorithms, machine learning, and back-end development. Academic interests outside of computer science include elementary number theory, algebra, and 20th century American literature. 

Starting last semester I practiced actively taking notes and writing or talking out loud about the stuff I learned.  I was quite happy with what how it turned out, so I plan on going a step further and keeping a small math/cs blog for the rest of my undergrad career. 

If you are a technical recruiter looking to contact me, you can reach me using LinkedIn or email. Otherwise, if you are from an academics background, you might be more comfortable using [this page](/about1.html).
